# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.0.0-beta.36] - 2026-08-12

### Added

- **Template Runs (L3)** — dedicated template endpoints plus asynchronous orchestrated runs: template revisions and config contracts, call-spec `inputs`/`url_mode` and `output.return_modes`, persisted `runtime` + `outputSchema`, an `OrchestratedRunner` that honors `max_concurrency`, a `template-run` worker, and the `template_runs` / `template_run_events` / `template_run_requests` ledgers backing run dispatch.
- **Dataset platform** — dedicated Dataset endpoints (L1 + L2) with `jsonb`-direct querying, async exports (JSONL/CSV), run-item membership, RFC-6901 projection, and `dataset_run` finalize for crawl. Batch scrape now writes results to a Dataset, reaching parity with scrape/crawl/search.
- JS SDK template client — `template` methods added to `@anycrawl/js-sdk` (published in 0.0.8).

### Fixed

- **Monitor** — overhauled reliability and the scheduled-execution lifecycle (auto-engine selection and execution-anchor handling).
- **SQLite migrations** — create the missing scheduler/webhook tables (`0020`) and backfill the missing `user_id` column (`0019`) so SQLite deployments match the PostgreSQL schema.
- **Billing** — fail-closed invariant now throws outside production instead of silently degrading.
- Dataset and template fixes surfaced by live PostgreSQL / integration testing (`create.name`, jsonb eq key cast, `fetchPage` request options, and others).

### Security

- **Template client validator** — block `setTimeout`/`setInterval` in user-supplied template code and add a code-length cap.

## [1.0.0-beta.35] - 2026-08-06

### Added

- **Batch Scrape API** — new asynchronous endpoint to scrape many known URLs in one job with a single shared set of scrape options (`POST /v1/batch/scrape`, `GET /v1/batch/scrape/:jobId/status`, `GET /v1/batch/scrape/:jobId`, `DELETE /v1/batch/scrape/:jobId`). Response shapes are separate from single `POST /v1/scrape`.
  - Per-URL billing: credits charged **per successfully scraped URL**; failed URLs are not charged; pre-flight `402` when the account lacks estimated credits.
  - Scrape template support: `template_id` + `variables` applied to every URL, with per-URL transforms, variable mapping/defaults, and domain restrictions enforced.
  - Webhook events: `batch_scrape.created`, `batch_scrape.started`, `batch_scrape.page`, `batch_scrape.completed`, `batch_scrape.failed`, `batch_scrape.cancelled`.
  - Configurable via `ANYCRAWL_BATCH_SCRAPE_MAX_URLS` (default 10000), `ANYCRAWL_BATCH_SCRAPE_CONCURRENCY` (default 10), `ANYCRAWL_BATCH_SCRAPE_WAIT_BUFFER_MS` (default 60000).
- JS SDK batch scrape methods: `batchScrape()` (create + poll + aggregate), `createBatchScrape()`, `getBatchScrapeStatus()`, `getBatchScrapeResults()`, `cancelBatchScrape()` (published in `@anycrawl/js-sdk` 0.0.7).
